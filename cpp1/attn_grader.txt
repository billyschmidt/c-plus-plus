A few notes about this submission -

1. Since there seems to be a lot of confusion about which files to include
   I've included pretty much everything there is.
   
2. After completion of certain steps within the explotations, I've compared my
   code with the author's. Upon verification, I've then made some updates which
   better reflect the intended lesson. So if my code looks very similar to the
   author's, that is why. I wanted to state clearly that I did 
   not just copy the code from the book.
   
3. If you have any questions about anything, feel free to question me about
   any of these programs, as I will be able to verbally demonstrate my
   knowledge.
   
Thanks,
